# Na-ve-Bayesian-classifier
Histogram of gradients is a highly accurate method of extracting features from the MNIST dataset for
handwritten digits, however, due to the number of computations required, the efficiency of
the model is in consideration. By using feature extraction on the MNIST dataset, the general
performance of the Na¨ıve Bayesian classifier had shown to improve tremendously with the
use of the Histogram of gradients although the results for the pixel intensity feature set were
surprisingly low, as much as 5 times less than HOG
